# DNA-beginner
My first Python project integrates what I have learned into a bioengineering machine learning tool. It takes a 3'-5' DNA strand as input and generates its 5'-3' complementary DNA strand. From there, it transcribes the sequence into mRNA and then translates it into a protein chain. The transcription and translation processes are powered by dictionaries and code I created, while I later integrated BioPython to handle DNA strand formation.

Currently, I have written all of the code but plan to update it to include libraries such as NumPy and BioPython more extensively. I am also working on tracking the proteins expressed from an inserted DNA strand and identifying mutations that can indicate diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, by comparing them with healthy gene expressions.
